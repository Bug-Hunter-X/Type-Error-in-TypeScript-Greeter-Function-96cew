# Type Error in TypeScript Greeter Function

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and its solution.

## The Bug

The `greeter` function expects a string argument, but it receives an array of strings. This results in a type error.

## The Solution

The solution involves modifying the function to accept an array or selecting a single element from the array to pass to the function.
